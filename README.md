# Study Time Tracker

This program asks the user how many hours they studied today and then estimates how many hours they will study in a full week if they continue at the same pace. It also includes simple error handling so the program does not crash if someone enters something that isn't a number.

## How to Run

Open a terminal in this folder and run:

```bash
python3 app.py
```

If your system uses python instead of python3, you can run:

```bash
python app.py
```
